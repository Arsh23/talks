## Distill Launch
* Google reserach journal
* Features: more ofcus on understanding, Visualization of algos and Code
* More focus on transperency 
* First edition features: Handwriting with ANN, Attention and Augmented RNNs, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) plots

## GeoGuesser
* guessing geolocation with photos

## DeepVoice by Baidu
* Text-to-speech system constructed entirely from deep neural networks as compared to modern TTS which arecomplex, multi-stage processing pipelines, each of which may rely on hand-engineered features and heuristics
* Less labour intensive and easier to program
